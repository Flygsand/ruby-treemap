= RubyTreemap

RubyTreemap is a library for generating treemaps in ruby. RubyTreemap provides
an interface for creating treemaps and rendering them in multiple formats.
Treemaps are an effective tool for visualizing data sets and are commonly used
to display hierarchical data. Treemaps were first designed by Ben Shneiderman
at the University of Maryland. For more information and the history of
treemaps see: http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/treemap-history/index.shtml

RubyTreemap is still in the early stages of development but a few of the
features that are implemented include:

* Slice and Dice layout
* Squarified layout
* HTML output
* SVG output
* PNG output (RMagick required)

== Dependencies

* RMagick (http://rmagick.rubyforge.org/) - For image output only
